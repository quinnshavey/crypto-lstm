# crypto-lstm
In February 2025, I finished my previous personal project, the Solana Sniper bot, and wanted to start another project. I wanted to do something related to AI and also Crypto, so I decided to try to create an AI model that can accurately predict crypto prices for Etheruem and SUI coins. This project was the first time I had used TensorFlow and the learning curve was not as bad as I had thought it would be luckily. This project also taught me how to use databases more effectively and taught me more data processing skills than I knew before, namely using Pandas and Dataframes to handle and store the training data. The architecture of the AI was determined based off of what my computer could handle training reasonably speedy and also what would achieve accuracy. For this model I settled on a Bidirectional LSTM model with three layers (256, 128, 64) mixed with dropout layers to not overfit. I also used early stopping so that the model would not overtrain and a sequence length of 70 and batch size of 64. The file aggregate_data.py is what fetches the data from the MySQL database and prepare_training_data.py takes the data from aggregate_data.py and then calculates the technical indicators. lstm_train.py is the main program that calls prepare_training_data.py and then takes the data from that call and uses it to train the LSTM AI model and then save it to the current directory.
